              The concept began with a simple observation: students and job-seekers
              often struggle to find meaningful internships, while organizations face
              inefficiencies in managing candidates. This mismatch inspired the creation
              of a centralized platform that addresses both needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started by identifying pain points through user interviews and
              institutional feedback. From there, we brainstormed solutions and
              sketched initial wireframes. These ideas evolved through multiple
              iterationsâ€”balancing technical feasibility with user expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a validated concept, we built a prototype that featured core functions
              like skill-based matching and onboarding dashboards. User testing with
              students and HR managers refined these features further, revealing the
              need for real-time progress tracking and performance insights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our project is now transitioning from prototype to full-fledged platform.
              With stakeholder input, strong design foundations, and a clear
              development roadmap, the platform is on track to transform internship and
              project placements into a streamlined, collaborative experience.
